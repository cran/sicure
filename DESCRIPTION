Description: Single-index mixture cure models allow estimating the probability of cure and the latency depending on a vector (or functional) covariate, avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The vector of parameters that defines the model can be estimated by maximum likelihood. A nonparametric estimator for the conditional density of the susceptible population is provided. For more details, see Piñeiro-Lamas (2024) (<https://ruc.udc.es/dspace/handle/2183/37035>).
